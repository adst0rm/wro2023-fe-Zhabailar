**EV3-based steering rack robot mobility control:**

1. **Motor selection:**
    - The choice of motor types depends on the requirements for speed, maneuverability and load of the robot.
    - Medium motor and large motor can be used for drive and steering rack, providing the necessary torque and speed.

2. **Implementation of engine selection:**
    - Analyze the requirements for the robot and distribute the functions between the motors.
    - Set up software control to synchronize the operation of the engines and provide the desired characteristics of the movement.

3. **Design and chassis selection:**
    - Choose the optimal shape and materials for the chassis, taking into account weight, center of gravity and maneuverability.
    - Take into account the need to place all components (motors, sensors) on the chassis.

4. **Installation of accessories on the car:**
    - Position the medium motor and large motor so that the robot has optimal weight distribution and balance.
    - Place the sensors (color sensor, gyro sensor, Pixy camera EV3 v2) so that they have a good view of the environment.

5. **Engineering principles and parameters:**
    - **Speed:** Program the motors to achieve the desired speed and take into account the restrictions on safe movement.
    - **Torque:** Select motors with sufficient torque to overcome driving resistance and maneuver.
    - **Power:** Calculate the required power to provide the required performance and efficiency of the robot.

6. **Use of sensors:**

    - **Color Sensor:** Use to recognize colors in the path of the robot, possibly to identify colored markers or instructions.

    - **Pixy camera EV3 v2:** Use to recognize objects by color, which can be useful for offline navigation or recognition tasks.

This discussion outline covers the key aspects of EV3-based Steering Rack Robot mobility management, including choice of motors, chassis design, component mounting, and use of sensors.
